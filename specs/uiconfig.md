Create a `uiconfig.json` file to configure the user interface.

* Defines the preferred patterns
* Controls the appearance of your components
* Provides an abstraction between your design spec and its implementation


Libraries integrate with your configuration.

* Libraries may advertise their support of ui patterns so you can know if they will integrate correctly with your app
* Libraries may use your config to customize their appearance and behavior
* Libraries may expose their own patterns that you may customize
