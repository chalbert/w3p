# World Wide Wed Platform (W3P)

World Wide Wed Platform (W3P) - is a project that aims to develop a coherent set of standards that support Web applications development.

Current standards are just not sufficient to develop modern applications. Many concepts remain unsupported and concerns unresolved. Additionally, even where new standards have been created like Web Components, the lack of guidance for implementers makes it very hard to create codes that will interoperate between applications.

In short, the goal of the Platform is to provide supports to build standard-based applications.
